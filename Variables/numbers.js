// John wants to buy 2 pairs of socks with free shipping and 1 basket balls that has shipping fees.

var socks = 10.90 * 2;
var basketBall = 20.95;
var shippingFees = 4.99;

var total = socks + basketBall + shippingFees;

console.log(total);

// this purchase has a 10% tax

// FLOATS
var first = 0.1 
var second =  0.2
var tots = ( first + second ).toFixed(1);

console.log (parseFloat(tots));
// best practise to avoid inacuracies
